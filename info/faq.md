# FAQ

## Is this for iOS, Android, Xbox, PS4?

No, this is only for Windows 10.

## Can I code a 1.16.220 client out of this?

No, you can't not unless you have client instances and other code. We will be working on a guide in the future if we ever find a way to make this 1.16.220 but you are not.
