# Building

## Why should we build? ðŸ¤” \(For noobs\)

The main reason why we should build is for our .DLL, this could be used for sharing our client and trying it out!

## How to build

First open the directory down below!

```text
/Horion-master/Horion.sln
```

After you open Visual Studio, go click the Build button and click Build Situation

{% hint style="info" %}
Ctrl + Shift + B for it to automatically build without going to build!
{% endhint %}

If it doesn't say build complete, you got an error. Check the errors guide and you must be set!
